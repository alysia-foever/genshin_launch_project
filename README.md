# Pintos

Project skeleton code for undergraduate OS class (DCS216) at Sun Yat-sen University.

## Introduction

[Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is an educational operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](src/LICENSE)).

## Acknowledgement

This source code is adapted from professor ([Ryan Huang](ryanph@umich.edu)) at University of Michigan (previously at JHU), who also taught a similar undergraduate OS course. He made some changes to the original Pintos labs.
